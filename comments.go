This page will contain self commentary to make it easier to remember things,
as well as reminding me where I left off from my previous sessions.
It will also have quotes and info I find helpful.

"The Go compiler internally places “;” as the statement terminator to indicate the end of one logical entity."
^ This is amazing.

Most of what I am covering here is just reading, so there isn't much coding to do.package main

derived types:
struggled with pointers in uni - will look into it more
union/slice/interface/map/channel types all sound new to me.
Will delve more into them as they come up.

byte == uint8
rune == int32
uintptr "an unsigned integer to store the uninterpreted bits of a pointer value"

"lvalue − Expressions that refer to a memory location is called "lvalue" expression.
An lvalue may appear as either the left-hand or right-hand side of an assignment."
"rvalue − The term rvalue refers to a data value that is stored at some address in memory.
An rvalue is an expression that cannot have a value assigned to it which means an rvalue may appear on the right-
but not left-hand side of an assignment."
Ivalue = data location
Rvalue = data

"A program can have the same name for local and global variables
but the value of the local variable inside a function takes preference."

"The Go platform provides various libraries to manipulate strings."
	- unicode
	- regexp
	- strings

"Pointers in Go are easy and fun to learn."
We'll see about that...
